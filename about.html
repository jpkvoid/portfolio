    <p class="caption"><strong>Julien Palluel Kochnitzky is a pianist, composer, multimedia artist and creative
        programmer born in 1994 in Lausanne, Switzerland. After taking classical piano
        lessons at the Lausanne Conservatoire, he starts his professional music studies
        at the jazz and pop music school EJMA, still in Lausanne, in the preparatory
        course for music Bachelor. After two years he goes on to start his Bachelor in
        jazz piano at the Royal Conservatoire of the Hague, Netherlands, where he
        improves on his instrumental technique and his composition and arranging skills.<br><br>

        He graduates from his Bachelor in July 2022 with a minor in Sonology, where he
        studied electronic music through audio programming with classes such as Live
        Processes with Max MSP or Algorithmic Composition. With theses new skills he
        takes part in sound installations and starts to create visual and audio-visual
        algorithmic works. At the same time he starts to program his own synthesizers
        and now mainly plays his own instruments (if not the piano) in live and
        studio settings.<br><br>

        Throughout the years and projects he plays on many
        stages such as: Montreux Jazz Festival, Festi'Neuch, Cully Jazz Festival, Label
        Suisse, Prémices Festival, La Spirale, to name a few.
        He also composes and plays for two projects in collaboration with the Musée de
        l'Élysée, Lausanne's photography museum, writing pieces for and played in front
        of some of the works of their exhibitions.<br><br>

        Oscillating between Switzerland and the Netherlands, his projects range from
        Etienne Machine's electornic rock to his own project based on contemporary jazz,
        tinted by electronic music and for which he writes his own programs that are at
        the core of the compositions.<br><br>

        He enrolls in the Sonology Department of the Royal Conservatoire of the Hague
        starting in September 2022 to deepen his knowledge of electronic music, studying
        the works of the masters such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, Iannis Xenakis or Pierre
        Schaeffer.</strong></p>
